Remember that computers must run COMPILED programs! Do not think of the program as the source code. The program is the compiled machine code.

objdump -D filename -M intel -- Shows executable info in intel assembly
gdb -- C debugger, must compile program with -g option for gdb to work

Hacking will use the Intel assembly flavor - in general, operation <destination>, <source>



GDB -

list - show source code
disassemble <function> - show dump of function
break <function> - add break point at function
run - begin execution of program
info register <reg> - display current state of register
x - examine, takes 
    /o (octal), 
    /x (hex), 
    /u (unsigned int), 
    /t (binary),
    /i (instruction),
    /c (ASCII character),
    /s (string)

e.g. x/x $rip will display the current contents of the index pointer as a hex number

nexti - next instruction



-- One word is four bytes - 32 bits!
Default size of memory units is one word
Word = DWORD (double word)
