Data types

Strings in C are represented as an array of chars

e.g.

char mystring[10]  // a ten character string

You can then add each element to the string one at a time

Alternatively, you can use the strcpy function, found in string.h

char mystring[10];
strcpy(mystring, "Hello world!\n");


Pointers
--------

Pointers contain addresses of other data and are denoted with *

e.g.

int *myptr = &myint; // put the address of myint into myptr

printf(*myptr); // dereference myptr (prints the value at the address)

Arrays are passed as pointers.
